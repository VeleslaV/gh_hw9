        title: We choose to go to the moon in this decade
        img: img_1.jpg
        body: We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win. As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class. We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other

        title: Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon
        img: img_3.jpg
        body: Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10. As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest. NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go. We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.

        title: Buy why, some say, the moon?
        img: img_5.jpg
        body: Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain? Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind. What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth. Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airmans earth, if free men make it, will be truly round a globe in practice, not in theory. We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.

        title: It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth
        img: img_0.jpg
        body: It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small. Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airmans earth, if free men make it, will be truly round a globe in practice, not in theory. For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us. Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination. The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.
